# Customer Support Salesforce Integration

This is a Salesforce DX project that serves as the backend for a Customer Support Portal. It allows support agents to view, manage, and resolve cases submitted from an external Laravel frontend via Salesforce's REST API.

In essence, this project is a simple, full-stack ticketing system that simulates how real companies handle customer support requests through a web form, storing and managing those requests inside Salesforce â€” a widely-used CRM platform.

# How it works

1. Customer visits Laravel site â†’ Submits support form

2. Laravel â†’ Sends POST request to Salesforce REST API

3. Salesforce â†’ Receives, stores as a Case object

4. Support Agent (logged into Salesforce) â†’ Views the Case in the LWC dashboard

5. Agent â†’ Responds, resolves, updates Case status
